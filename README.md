# Marketing-Campaign-Analysis

This project delves into the intricate realm of marketing campaign effectiveness, utilizing a 
comprehensive methodology encompassing both linear and non-linear machine learning 
approaches. The goal of this project is to identify the key factors that influence a customer's 
likelihood of responding positively to marketing campaigns. The study uses a comprehensive 
dataset, "marketing_campaign," to investigate the relationships between customer characteristics 
and their responses to marketing efforts. By applying a range of machine learning methods, 
including logistic regression, classification trees, pruned classification trees, and gradient boosting, 
this project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify the most significant 
predictors of customer response. The ultimate objective is to provide actionable insights for 
optimizing marketing strategies and enhancing customer engagement.
